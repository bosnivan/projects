# Oxocard Connect
Various projects made with [Oxocard Connect](https://oxocard.ch/en/connect/).

## Arduino
Instead of [NanoPy](https://editor.nanopy.io/), which I'll explore with **Oxocard Science**, here most projects will be **Arduino**. I'm using **ESP32 Dev Module** board definition, **TFT_eSPI** library for screen (check User_Setup.h) and **ezButton** for buttons (they can also be accessed directly or through other similar libraries).
