# Oxocard Connect
Various projects made with [Oxocard Connect](https://oxocard.ch/en/connect/).

## Arduino
Instead of [NanoPy](https://editor.nanopy.io/), which I'll explore with **Oxocard Science**, here most projects will be **Arduino**. I'm using **ESP32 Dev Module** board definition, **TFT_eSPI** library for screen (check [User_Setup.h](https://github.com/bosnivan/projects/blob/main/Oxocard%20Connect/User_Setup.h)) and **ezButton** for buttons (they can also be accessed directly or through other similar libraries).

## Projects
- [Demo](https://github.com/bosnivan/projects/tree/main/Oxocard%20Connect/Demo) - Test project which shows on screen which button is pressed.
- [Lego Duplo train controller](https://github.com/bosnivan/projects/tree/main/Oxocard%20Connect/LegoDuploTrainBleController) - Controlling Lego Duplo Train with BLE communication. | [Video](https://twitter.com/PlusPlusInt/status/1754185711886966817)
